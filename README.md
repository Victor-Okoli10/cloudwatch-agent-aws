It can be scary to think you cant do the one thing that needs to get done but it's even scarier to realize that years past and you still in the same place you've been.
Get up an fail multiple times until one day you dont. 
That's what success is, its just failing multiple times until you realize the one thing you kept doing wrong actually became right.
